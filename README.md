## FINA3327 Group 8 Sentiment analysis strategy

### Description
We are a long-short equity hedge fund, benchmarking S&P 100, the most marketable and liquid US stock universe. Leveraging the textual analysis by the FinBERT model, we allocate 50% of the portfolio to establish a long position on the top 20 percentile of stocks and allocate the remaining half to a short position on the bottom 10 percentile according to the performance rank generated by the model.

In this repository, we stored the codes, data and results for the three stages of our sentiment analysis strategy:
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Pre-processing
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Backtesting
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Return analysis

### Pre-processing
1. Extract and download quarterly earning call transcripts of S&P 100 constitute companies from Bloomberg from 2016 to 2020. 
2. Convert the earnings call transcript from pdf format to txt (using totxt.py)
3. Using the FinBERT model to read the earning calls transcripts and generate sentiment classification (i.e. positive, neutral or negative) from the text. This process is repeated for each constitutes company and each quarter. (using sentiment generation.py)
4. A net value technique, PN Score is reported for each company in S&P 100 quarterly, details are shown below:
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;P = numbers of positive sentences 
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;N = numbers of negative sentences 
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PN Score = (P â€“ N) / (P + N) 
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;where
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;P - N: difference between the number of positive and negative sentences
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 / (P + N): normalizing this difference by the total number of sentences in the transcript 

The graph below serves for better illustration purposes.
