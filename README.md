## FINA3327 Group 8 Sentiment analysis strategy

### Description
We are a long-short equity hedge fund, benchmarking S&P 100, the most marketable and liquid US stock universe. Leveraging the textual analysis by the FinBERT model, we allocate 50% of the portfolio to establish a long position on the top 20 percentile of stocks and allocate the remaining half to a short position on the bottom 10 percentile according to the performance rank generated by the model.

In this repository, we stored the codes, data and results for the three stages of our sentiment analysis strategy:
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Pre-processing
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Backtesting
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Return analysis
